# A global analysis of expected revenues from carbon dioxide removal

This repository contains the R scripts used to generate the figures included in the manuscript submission. 
Data used in Figure 1 cannot be shared due to participant privacy constraints. Data supporting Figures 2, 4, and 5 will be made available upon reasonable request. Data for Figure 3 are available from the following sources: historical EU ETS prices from the World Bank Carbon Pricing Dashboard (https://carbonpricingdashboard.worldbank.org/), EU ETS forecasts from the Ariadne Project (https://ariadneprojekt.de/), and cost data from the literature cited. 

Each script is designed to create a specific figure. Additionally, there is a dedicated script for generating Figure 1 and Table 2 from the Supplementary Information (SI).

Note: Please set the working directory to the root of this repository before running any scripts.
