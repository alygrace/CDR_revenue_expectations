# A global analysis of expected revenues from carbon dioxide removal

This repository contains the R scripts used to generate the figures included in the manuscript submission. Due to privacy constraints, the underlying data—collected through structured interviews—cannot be shared.

Each script is designed to create a specific figure. Additionally, there is a dedicated script for generating Figure 1 and Table 2 from the Supplementary Information (SI).

Note: Please set the working directory to the root of this repository before running any scripts.
